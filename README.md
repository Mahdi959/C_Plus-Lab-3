# C_Plus-Lab-3
CS132-02 Lab 3
Spring 2022

Instructions: One of the useful things about dynamic memory is that you can essentially change the size of a dynamically created array (make a bigger one, copy values, change pointer, etc.)

	•	For this lab, you will use the program given to you (lab3.cpp) and finish it by writing the definition of the addSize function called on line 25.
	•	Prototype on top, definition on bottom
	•	Don’t forget about deallocating, if necessary (probably)
	•	You will also add code to main that adds values to the new spaces that were added
	•	See the comment on line 28
	•	You don’t have to change anything else in main()
	•	Make sure you have the correct comments on top.
	•	Email me the finished lab3.cpp file
